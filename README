The project consists of 11 files so far.
It uses only Libevent as an external library.
The Libevent library can be downloaded from https://github.com/downloads/libevent/libevent/libevent-2.0.21-stable.tar.gz

The tutorial to compile libevent in Linux (Sample tutorial found on the Internet!!):
Open console and type the following:

wget http://monkey.org/~provos/libevent-1.4.14b-stable.tar.gz
$ tar xzf libevent-1.4.14b-stable.tar.gz
$ cd libevent-1.4.14b-stable
$ ./configure --prefix=/opt/libevent
# hopefully, you haven't encountered any errors so far
$ make
# make install

You should have libevent installed in /opt/libevent. To make sure:

ls -la /opt/libevent

Tutorial to compile Libevent in Windows:
Open console and type the following (For example VS2010 User Command Prompt):
cd \where\you\put\it
nmake -f makefile.nmake

Hopefully you will get 3 .lib files: libevent.lib libevent_core.lib libevent_extras.lib. Link them all to the project.
Remember to add additional include directories: ../libevent/include
Unfortunately I don't have a makefile for the project so if you would provide one I would be grateful.
Compile and hope it will work:)

The program consist of classes: client, baseserver, mainserv, serverlogic
The base class for all classes is mainserv (The base decorator class).
The class implementing Libevent methods handling incoming connections is baseserver.
As soon as baseserver class does its job, it handles the control to serverlogic class. It is happening by calling the functions of the same name in the baseserver's methods.
Serverlogic implements the vector of clients to keep track of the connections with them as well as is responsible for musticasting messages to other connected clients. You can try opening a few simple clients and test it.
That's it. Try and work on your part.
